# pythonPractice
Quick and short Python practical sessions to reaffirm python skills

*Nov 2021*

These sessions were split into 2 practical sessions to help develop my skills however, I was fairly confident with python by this point in my learning. Each session has a range of problems that were given to solve.

*Files are explained in alphabetical order with each session so some tasks may lead on from other excerises later on in the practical*
